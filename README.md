Project Euler

www.projecteuler.com is a website with over 400+ math problems that have to be solved with computer programming 

So far, I have solved 1-10, and 48 - ~55. I skipped to 48 because a lot of the starting problems are very easy and uninteresting. I am still solving problems in my
spare time, and have been getting better and better problem to problem.

the file eulerTools/Tools.java contains several functions that I use for various problems, or think I will have to use again.
    For example Tools.getPrimes(int num) generates a boolean array with num + 1 slots. Each index represents that number, eg arr[5] represents the number 5, 
    and if it returns true, that number is prime. I generate the primes using the sieve algorithm. I figured this data structure would be the best representation
    of primes because it has a hashtable like property in which seeing if a number n is prime, with also a certain order. 

Also, see later problems for better code/efficency
